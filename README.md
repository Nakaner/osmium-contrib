Osmium Contrib
==============

This directory contains a mixed bunch of more or less useful examples of how to
work with the Osmium library.

You have to set up Osmium first. See http://osmcode.org/osmium .


LICENSE
=======

All contributions have their own licenses.


BUILDING
========

All programs can simply be compiled by calling "make" in their respective
directories.

This will work easiest if you have Osmium installed in your normal INCLUDE path
or if the libosmium git repository is checked out in the same directory as the
"contrib" directory.
